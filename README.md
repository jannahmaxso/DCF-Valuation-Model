# DCF-Valuation-Model
This discounted cash flow valuation model is a personal project to practice and demonstrate my skills in corporate finance and modeling. For this, I used data from PSE-listed companies and performed equity valuation, acquisition fairness checks, capital budgeting, fundraising valuation, and a sensitivity analysis.
